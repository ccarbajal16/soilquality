\title{Plot SQI Results}
\usage{
\method{plot}{sqi_result}(
  x,
  type = c("distribution", "indicators", "weights", "scree", "biplot"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "sqi_result" returned by
\code{\link{compute_sqi}}, \code{\link{compute_sqi_df}}, or
\code{\link{compute_sqi_properties}}.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the plot type. Options are:
\describe{
  \item{"distribution"}{Histogram of SQI values with mean line}
  \item{"indicators"}{Boxplots of indicator scores}
  \item{"weights"}{Bar chart of AHP weights with CR annotation}
  \item{"scree"}{Variance explained by PCs with cumulative line}
  \item{"biplot"}{PCA biplot of observations and variables}
}}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly). The function is called for its side effect of
  creating a plot.
}
\description{
S3 plot method for sqi_result objects. Provides multiple visualization
types to explore and communicate Soil Quality Index results and analysis
components.
}
\details{
The function creates different visualizations based on the \code{type}
parameter:

\strong{Distribution Plot:} Shows the distribution of SQI values across
all samples using a histogram. A vertical line indicates the mean SQI.

\strong{Indicators Plot:} Displays boxplots for each scored indicator,
allowing comparison of score distributions across different soil
properties.

\strong{Weights Plot:} Shows the AHP weights assigned to each indicator
as a bar chart. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is annotated on the plot.

\strong{Scree Plot:} Displays the proportion of variance explained by
each principal component, with both individual (bars) and cumulative
(line) variance shown.

\strong{Biplot:} Creates a PCA biplot showing both observations (points)
and variable loadings (arrows), useful for understanding relationships
between samples and soil properties.

# Create example data

  pH = rnorm(20, 6.5, 0.5),
  OM = rnorm(20, 3, 0.5)

# Compute SQI
result <- compute_sqi_df(soil_data, id_column = "SampleID")

# Distribution plot
plot(result, type = "distribution")

# Indicators plot
plot(result, type = "indicators")

# Weights plot
plot(result, type = "weights")

# Scree plot
plot(result, type = "scree")

# Biplot
plot(result, type = "biplot")
