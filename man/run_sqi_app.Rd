\title{Launch Interactive Soil Quality Index Calculator}
\usage{
run_sqi_app(launch.browser = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{launch.browser}{Logical value indicating whether to launch the app
in the system's default web browser. If TRUE (default), the app opens
in a browser window. If FALSE, the app URL is printed to the console
and can be opened manually.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{shiny::runApp()}, such as
\code{port} to specify a custom port number, or \code{host} to specify
the host IP address.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It runs the Shiny
  application until the user stops it (typically by closing the browser
  window or pressing Ctrl+C in the R console).
}
\description{
Launches a Shiny web application that provides an interactive graphical
interface for computing Soil Quality Index (SQI). The app allows users
to upload data, select properties, configure scoring rules, and visualize
results without writing code.
}
\details{
The Shiny application provides the following features:
\itemize{
  \item File upload for soil data CSV files
  \item Property selection (auto-detect, pre-defined sets, or custom)
  \item Scoring rule configuration (standard rules or all higher-better)
  \item AHP weight specification (equal weights or upload matrix)
  \item Interactive results display with summary statistics
  \item Multiple visualization types (distribution, indicators, weights,
    scree plot)
  \item Download results as CSV file
}

The app is located in the package's \code{inst/shiny/} directory and is
automatically installed with the package. If the app directory cannot be
found, an error is raised indicating improper installation.

To stop the app, close the browser window and press Ctrl+C (or Esc) in
the R console, or click the stop button in RStudio.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Launch the app in default browser
run_sqi_app()

# Launch without opening browser (print URL only)
run_sqi_app(launch.browser = FALSE)

# Launch on a specific port
run_sqi_app(port = 8080)
}
