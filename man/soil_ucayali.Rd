\description{
A dataset containing soil physical, chemical, and fertility properties from
50 soil samples collected in the Ucayali region of Peru. This dataset is
provided as an example for demonstrating the soil quality index (SQI)
calculation workflow.
}
\details{
The dataset represents typical soil properties found in tropical agricultural
soils of the Ucayali region. Values are simulated but based on realistic
ranges for this region. The soils are generally acidic (pH 4-7.5), with
moderate organic matter content and variable nutrient levels.

This dataset can be used to:
\itemize{
  \item Demonstrate the complete SQI calculation workflow
  \item Test different property selection strategies
  \item Explore various scoring rules and weighting methods
  \item Generate example visualizations
}
