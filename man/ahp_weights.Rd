\title{Calculate AHP weights from pairwise comparison matrix}
\usage{
ahp_weights(pairwise, indicators = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairwise}{A square numeric matrix of pairwise comparisons where element [i,j]
represents the relative importance of indicator i compared to indicator j.
The matrix must be reciprocal (A[i,j] = 1/A[j,i]) with diagonal values equal to 1.}

\item{indicators}{Optional character vector of indicator names. If NULL, uses
row names from the pairwise matrix or generates default names.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
  \item{weights}{Named numeric vector of normalized weights summing to 1}
  \item{CR}{Consistency Ratio, a measure of logical consistency (should be < 0.1)}
  \item{lambda_max}{Maximum eigenvalue of the pairwise matrix}
}
\description{
This function calculates indicator weights using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
method based on a pairwise comparison matrix. It computes weights using eigenvalue
decomposition and calculates the Consistency Ratio (CR) to assess the logical
consistency of the judgments.
}
\details{
The AHP method uses eigenvalue decomposition to derive weights from pairwise
comparisons. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is calculated as:
\deqn{CR = CI / RI}
where CI (Consistency Index) = (lambda_max - n) / (n - 1) and RI is the
Random Consistency Index that depends on matrix size.

A CR value less than 0.1 indicates acceptable consistency. Values exceeding
0.1 suggest that the pairwise judgments may be inconsistent and should be revised.

# Create a 3x3 pairwise comparison matrix
pairwise <- matrix(c(
  1,   3,   5,
  1/3, 1,   2,
  1/5, 1/2, 1
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Calculate weights
result <- ahp_weights(pairwise, indicators = c("pH", "OM", "P"))
