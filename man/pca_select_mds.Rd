\title{Select Minimum Data Set (MDS) Using PCA}
\usage{
pca_select_mds(data, var_threshold = 0.05, loading_threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing standardized soil property measurements.
All columns should be numeric. It is recommended to standardize the data
using \code{\link{standardize_numeric}} before applying PCA.}

\item{var_threshold}{Numeric value specifying the minimum proportion of
variance a principal component must explain to be retained. Components
with variance below this threshold are excluded from MDS selection.
Default is 0.05 (5\%).}

\item{loading_threshold}{Numeric value specifying the minimum absolute
loading value for a variable to be considered for selection within a
principal component. Variables with absolute loadings below this threshold
are not selected. Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{mds}{Character vector of selected variable names representing
      the minimum data set.}
    \item{pca}{The PCA object returned by \code{stats::prcomp}, containing
      the full PCA results including rotation matrix, scores, and other
      components.}
    \item{loadings}{Numeric matrix of variable loadings (rotation matrix)
      for all principal components.}
    \item{var_exp}{Numeric vector containing the proportion of variance
      explained by each principal component.}
  }
}
\description{
Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on soil property data and
selects a minimum data set (MDS) of indicators based on variance and
loading thresholds. This function implements the PCA-based MDS selection
methodology commonly used in soil quality assessment.
}
\details{
The MDS selection algorithm follows these steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Perform PCA using \code{stats::prcomp} with scaling disabled
    (data should be pre-standardized).
  \item Calculate the proportion of variance explained by each PC.
  \item Identify PCs that explain variance greater than \code{var_threshold}.
  \item For each retained PC, identify the variable with the maximum
    absolute loading that exceeds \code{loading_threshold}.
  \item Return the unique set of selected variables as the MDS.
}

If no variables meet the selection criteria, an empty character vector
is returned for the MDS component.

# Create example soil data
soil_data <- data.frame(
  Sand = c(45, 50, 42, 48, 52, 38, 44, 49),
  Silt = c(30, 28, 35, 32, 25, 40, 33, 29),
  Clay = c(25, 22, 23, 20, 23, 22, 23, 22),
  pH = c(6.5, 7.0, 6.8, 7.2, 6.9, 6.7, 7.1, 6.6),
  OM = c(3.2, 2.8, 3.5, 3.0, 2.9, 3.3, 3.1, 3.4)
)

# Standardize the data first
soil_std <- standardize_numeric(soil_data)

# Select MDS using PCA
result <- pca_select_mds(soil_std)

# View selected indicators
print(result$mds)

# View variance explained
print(result$var_exp)

# Use custom thresholds
result2 <- pca_select_mds(soil_std,
                          var_threshold = 0.10,
                          loading_threshold = 0.6)
