\title{Convert importance ratios to Saaty pairwise comparison matrix}
\usage{
ratio_to_saaty(ratios)
}
\arguments{
\item{ratios}{Numeric vector of importance ratios. Each value represents
how many times more important an indicator is compared to a baseline.
Values should be positive numbers.}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix of pairwise comparisons where element [i,j]
  represents the relative importance of indicator i compared to indicator j.
  The matrix is reciprocal with diagonal values equal to 1.
}
\description{
This helper function converts a vector of importance ratios into a pairwise
comparison matrix following the Saaty scale (1-9). The ratios represent the
relative importance of each indicator compared to a baseline.
}
\details{
The function constructs a pairwise comparison matrix from importance ratios
by calculating the ratio between each pair of indicators. For indicators with
ratios r_i and r_j, the pairwise comparison is r_i / r_j.

The Saaty scale typically uses values from 1/9 to 9, where:
\itemize{
  \item 1 = Equal importance
  \item 3 = Moderate importance
  \item 5 = Strong importance
  \item 7 = Very strong importance
  \item 9 = Extreme importance
  \item 2, 4, 6, 8 = Intermediate values
}
}
\examples{
# Three indicators with importance ratios 5:3:1
ratios <- c(5, 3, 1)
pairwise <- ratio_to_saaty(ratios)
print(pairwise)

# Calculate weights from the matrix
result <- ahp_weights(pairwise, indicators = c("pH", "OM", "P"))
