\title{Pre-defined soil property sets}
\format{
A named list with the following property sets:
\describe{
  \item{basic}{A minimal set of 4 fundamental soil properties: pH,
    organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Suitable
    for quick assessments with limited data.}
  \item{standard}{A comprehensive set of 9 commonly measured properties:
    Sand, Silt, Clay, pH, OM, nitrogen (N), P, K, and cation exchange
    capacity (CEC). Recommended for most soil quality assessments.}
  \item{comprehensive}{An extensive set of 15 properties including all
    standard properties plus bulk density (BD), electrical conductivity
    (EC), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and sulfur (S).
    Suitable for detailed soil characterization.}
  \item{physical}{Physical properties only: Sand, Silt, Clay, and BD.
    Focuses on soil structure and texture characteristics.}
  \item{chemical}{Chemical properties only: pH, EC, CEC, Ca, Mg, K, Na.
    Focuses on soil chemistry and nutrient availability.}
  \item{fertility}{Fertility-related properties: OM, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S,
    CEC. Focuses on nutrient supply and retention capacity.}
}

\description{
A list containing pre-defined sets of soil properties commonly used in
soil quality assessments. These sets can be used with the
\code{\link{standard_scoring_rules}} function to quickly configure
analyses for different scenarios.
