\title{Create a threshold-based scoring rule}
\usage{
threshold_scoring(thresholds, scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of threshold values (should be sorted
in ascending order)}

\item{scores}{Numeric vector of scores corresponding to each threshold.
Must have the same length as thresholds.}
}
\value{
A scoring_rule object of class c("scoring_rule",
  "threshold_scoring")
}
\description{
Creates a scoring rule object for indicators with custom piecewise
linear scoring based on threshold-score pairs. Values are scored using
linear interpolation between the specified thresholds.
}
\examples{
# Create a rule for phosphorus with custom thresholds
p_rule <- threshold_scoring(
  thresholds = c(0, 10, 20, 30),
  scores = c(0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)
)

# Create a rule with non-linear scoring pattern
custom_rule <- threshold_scoring(
  thresholds = c(0, 5, 15, 25, 40),
  scores = c(0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0, 0.9)
)
