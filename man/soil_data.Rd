\description{
An extended dataset containing soil physical, chemical, and fertility properties
from 50 soil samples collected in the Ucayali region of Peru. This dataset includes
all properties from \code{\link{soil_ucayali}} plus an additional sulfur (S) measurement.
}
\details{
This dataset extends \code{\link{soil_ucayali}} with sulfur measurements, providing
a more comprehensive view of soil fertility properties. The soils are generally
acidic (pH 4-7.5), with moderate organic matter content and variable nutrient levels
typical of tropical agricultural soils in the Ucayali region.

This dataset can be used to:
\itemize{
  \item Demonstrate SQI calculations with an extended set of soil properties
  \item Test property selection with additional nutrient parameters
  \item Compare results between standard and extended property sets
  \item Explore the impact of sulfur in soil quality assessment
}
}
